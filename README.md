sublime-text-config
===================

Instructions to config Sublime Text 2 according to my preferences

1 - Install Package Control
	- Install Sidebar Enhancements
	- Install Bracket Highlighter (to emphasize tags)

2 - Copy the theme files to "Color Scheme - Default" folder
	- Currently there's a Cobalt and a Monokai variant which highlight XML tags

Copy files below to "Packages/User" folder 
3 - Use keymap to change ctrl+tab behavior: remove "_in_stack" from commands
4 - bh_core.sublime-settings makes Bracket Highlighter work (only works on themes which have a color set for tags)
	- Currently only configured for XML tags

5 - Copy the file "Default.sublime-theme" to "Packages/User" folder
